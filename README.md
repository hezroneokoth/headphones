# Implement a Design from Scratch

## HTML CSS Responsive design

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

Here's the final result.

## Requirements

### General

1. You are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
2. You are not to use Javascript

## Tasks

### Read and be familiar with Figma

Create an account in Figma and open this project and “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.
If you can’t access to it, please find here the Figma file

Important notes with Figma:

if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT

some values are in float - feel free to round them

For this task, please write an amazing README.md

Interactions note:

The web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less

Links hover/active: #FF6565

Button hover/active: opacity: 0.9

Max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page

### Header

Building a web page the right way, is not easy - except if you put in place strong foundations:

reset CSS styling

use variables

simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors

avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector

simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

Last advice: Personally, I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom. But you can try to other way - it’s fine - but you should structure the way that you will implement a component and not get lost with HTML tags.

Now, your turn!

For this first task: create the header/hero piece

### "What we do..." section

Copy files from the previous task.

For this second task: create the “What we do…” section

In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: holberton_school-icon.zip Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.

Important: try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some components in next section.

### "Our results" section

Copy files from the previous task.

For this third task: create the “Our results” section

Now you can reuse components form the previous task!

### Contact us

Copy files from the previous task.

A good landing page has always a contact form.

You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

### Footer

Copy files from the previous task.

Last piece of the page… the Footer!
